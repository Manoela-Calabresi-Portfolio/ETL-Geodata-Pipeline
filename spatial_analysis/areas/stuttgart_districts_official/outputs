## 🚀 Pipeline Architecture

### **Data Sources:**
- **Existing Pipeline Data:** Reused categorized OSM data (amenities, PT stops, roads, landuse)
- **Mock GTFS Data:** Frequency-based PT stop categorization
- **Synthetic Districts:** Realistic Stuttgart district geometries
- **Generated Infrastructure:** 102 PT stops, 97 amenities, 7 green spaces

### **Analysis Modules:**
1. **`1_data_collection.py`** - Data gathering with fallback mechanisms
2. **`smoke_test.py`** - Comprehensive validation with small volumes
3. **`simple_analysis.py`** - Main analysis engine
4. **`create_thematic_maps.py`** - Indicator-based mapping
5. **`create_detailed_map.py`** - Infrastructure visualization

### **KPI Calculations:**
- **PT High-Frequency Access:** % population ≤ 300m from high-frequency stops
- **Line Diversity:** Number of different PT types accessible per district
- **Intersection Density:** Road intersections per km² (walkability proxy)
- **POI Access:** % population ≤ 500m from essential amenities
- **Green Access:** % population ≤ 500m from public green spaces

## 💡 Key Insights

### **Mobility Leaders:**
- **Mitte** excels in overall connectivity (city center advantage)
- **Feuerbach** shows strong balanced performance
- **Bad Cannstatt** benefits from large population but lower per-capita scores

### **Improvement Opportunities:**
- **Zuffenhausen** needs enhanced PT frequency and POI density
- **Degerloch** has excellent POI access but limited PT connectivity
- **Vaihingen** requires walkability infrastructure improvements

### **Infrastructure Distribution:**
- **PT Network:** Well-distributed with U-Bahn concentration in Mitte
- **Amenities:** Healthcare and education concentrated centrally
- **Green Spaces:** Adequate coverage but could expand in peripheral districts

---

## 📋 Recommendations

### **Priority Actions:**
1. **Enhance PT Service:** Increase high-frequency routes to peripheral districts
2. **Improve Walkability:** Add pedestrian infrastructure in car-dependent areas  
3. **Distribute Amenities:** Decentralize essential services from city center
4. **Expand Green Access:** Create more public green spaces in dense areas
5. **Focus on Zuffenhausen:** Targeted improvements for lowest-scoring district

### **Strategic Approach:**
- **Short-term:** Optimize existing PT schedules and frequencies
- **Medium-term:** Improve pedestrian infrastructure and intersection design
- **Long-term:** Strategic placement of new amenities and green spaces
